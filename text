Viva Question:

1.ECHO vs Print
-echo and print are more or less the same. They are both used to output data to the screen.
The differences are small: echo has no return value while print has a return value of 1 so it can be used in expressions. echo can take multiple parameters (although such usage is rare) while print can take one argument. echo is marginally faster than print.

2.=/==/===
-The assignment equality = operator only assigns values.
The equality == does not assign values, but compares them without checking their data types.
The triple equals sign operator === wonâ€™t do assignment, but will check for equality of values and the data type.

3.single quatation vs double quatation
A single-quoted string does not have variables within it interpreted. A double-quoted string does.

4.heredoc vs nowdoc
-



5.index array vs associative array
-Indexed arrays are used when you identify things by their position. Associative arrays have strings as keys

6.foreach()
The foreach loop works only on arrays, and is used to loop through each key/value pair in an array. 

7.$_GET vs $_POST
-
$_POST:
    PHP $_POST is a PHP super global variable which is used to collect form data after submitting an HTML form with method="post". $_POST is also widely used to pass variables.$_POST is an array of variables passed to the current script via the HTTP POST method.Information sent from a form with the POST method is invisible to others (all names/values are embedded within the body of the HTTP request) and has no limits on the amount of information to send.Moreover POST supports advanced functionality such as support for multi-part binary input while uploading files to server.However, because the variables are not displayed in the URL, it is not possible to bookmark the page.
    Note: Developers prefer POST for sending form data.
$_GET:
    PHP $_GET is a PHP super global variable which is used to collect form data after submitting an HTML form with method="get".$_GET can also collect data sent in the URL.Information sent from a form with the GET method is visible to everyone (all variable names and values are displayed in the URL). GET also has limits on the amount of information to send. The limitation is about 2000 characters. However, because the variables are displayed in the URL, it is possible to bookmark the page. This can be useful in some cases.GET may be used for sending non-sensitive data.
    Note: GET should NEVER be used for sending passwords or other sensitive information!
